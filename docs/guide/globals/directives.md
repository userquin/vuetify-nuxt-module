# Directives

By default, the module will not register any Vuetify directive. If you need to register some directive, use `vuetifyOptions.directives` module option, it has been declared properly to have better DX.

You can register all the directives or only the ones you need: check the [directives definition](https://github.com/userquin/vuetify-nuxt-module/blob/main/src/types.ts#L82-L83).
